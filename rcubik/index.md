So the framework I'm using lets you blog really easily, except I don't have that totally set up yet. I _think_ we'd have to get you your own hosted site for that, but that is cheap and/or free depending on how you want to do it! And then I could get that all set up for you. Once it's set up, the blogging itself is not hard. Although I guess you also have to decide whether blogging is a way you want to keep people updated on your doings.

Anyway: I've got a portfolio situation most of the way set up --- unless you don't care if the large images have captions, in which case it's all the way set up --- and everything related to the layout/fonts/colors can be changed however you want it.
