<h3>--- SAMR&#58; Conservation of Momentum ---</h3>

<h4 id="narrative">Narrative</h4>
<p>So when I taught phyiscs, conservation of momentum was, for some reason, very difficult for my kids to get. We’d just done energy and they totally got that, so I was surprised when conservation of momentum threw so many kids for a loop! So I developed a lesson around that.</p>

<p>I think it’s neat that throughout the SAMR process you develop several different lessons approaching the same material in different ways, so you could do the low-tech version to introduce the subject and the high-tech version to give students a different way to engage with the material. I moved from a chalk-talk/math practice lesson plan, to a digital lab using a PhET, to an IRL lab using special equipment and software. I like that there’s lots of classical physics PhETs out there, but I do think the most engaging way to learn classical physics is to make it happen yourself, in the real world, gathering real data. So a lab is definitely where I wanted to end up with this.</p>

<p>The special software/hardware I planned around all comes from PASCO, and the lab itself is pretty classic: two carts, on an air track, running into each other. But the carts have accelerometers and motion sensors that relay their readings via Bluetooth to the PASCO software, so the data gathering and processing is where the tech really comes in. It’s all real-time data gathering, and it’s really neat. You can run a similar version of this lab with stopwatches and meter sticks to get the velocity but that ends up being just RIFE with error. While no method is perfect, this high-tech approach is going to give students much better data to work with.</p>

<p>I wasn’t able to get the hardware, but I was able to do all kinds of good stuff with the software! It’s called Capstone, and while you do have to buy it for long-term use, they have a <a href="https://www.pasco.com/downloads/capstone/pasco-capstone-trial/index.cfm" target="_blank">free trial</a> on their website. It reads in data from its equipment, lets you process/manipulate/display those data, do lab notebook writeups, and do step-by-step guides. It even has a block coding interface for students to do engineering experiments!</p>

<p>If I taught somewhere where they had a lot of PASCO stuff, I think integrating Capstone into my labs would be really awesome. One of my products for this project is a step-by-step guide through the lab, giving students lots of scaffolding, which I think is appropriate for something like CP or Honors phyiscs. AP Physics labs are all about designing experiments, though, so in that case Capstone would be a GREAT tool. Students could program sensors however they need to and get really creative!</p>

<dt><a href="https://app.wizer.me/learn/02REKB" target="_blank">Wizer Pre-lab &gt;&gt;</a></dt><dd>Wizer is a really cool digital worksheet maker with lots of accessibility options! I used it to create a pre-lab that students would complete and submit. Like Google Forms, Wizer displays all the student results in a nice snapshot for you, but unlike Google Forms, it's really easy to make the worksheets accessible. By default, there's always a record option for students who would prefer to speak their answers rather than type. Wizer Lite is free, so that's what I used, but if you pay for the upgrade, you can create special differentiations for each question. It's AWESOME.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1umej6wgaB1FXvX8fsJ-vKknBCdCWg50U" target="_blank">Capstone Labs: Files and Previews &gt;&gt;</a></dt><dd> PASCO provides Capstone files for their labs, so I took their file and adapted it for my final product, which is a guide through the lab, with tables set up for students to record their data. They can type directly in the tables, gather data from the cart sensors, create and modify graphs based on functions they define. I also used PASCO's sample data files to show what it should look like when each step is followed, because I can't get all that hardware and actually run the lab. To view and play around with the Capstone files, you need to <a href="https://www.pasco.com/downloads/capstone/pasco-capstone-trial/index.cfm" target="_blank">download and install the free trial of Capstone</a>, but I have screenshots of each page in the guide in slideshows in case you don't want to install new software.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ipFeBpdVV6uPX2RYX2fPZhEV8oHEJik3" target="_blank">Shared Class Folder &gt;&gt;</a></dt><dd>This is where the students would access everything they needed for the lab, upload their Capstone files, and add their graph to the Results Share slideshow. I'm not submitting it as my Two Products but I figured I should still make it available!</dd>
