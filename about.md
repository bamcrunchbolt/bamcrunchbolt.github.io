<h3> --- About! ---</h3>

I used <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> to make this blog, and it was really fun! If you're comfortable with coding, you might have a good time playing around with it!

The fonts on the site are Montserrat for the titles and Cousine for the body text; both are free on Google Fonts. 

The colors on this site are from the <a href="https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/" target="_blank">Solarized</a> color scheme. They're supposed to be easiest on the eyes. Probably they'd be even easier on the eyes if I went with the beige background, but if Ethan Schoonover doesn't do that, then why should I?
