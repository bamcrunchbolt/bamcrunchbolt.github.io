I used <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> to make this blog, and it was really fun! If you're comfortable with coding, you might have a good time playing around with it!

The fonts on the site are Montserrat for the titles and Cousine for the body text; both are free on Google Fonts.
