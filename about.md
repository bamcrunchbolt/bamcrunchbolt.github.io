### How did I make this website?
I lovingly hand-coded this website myself! 

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) gave me some infrastructure to combine HTML and Markdown and make my life easier.
- [Colormind](http://colormind.io) let me extract a color scheme from my Darwin photo and [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com) let me check for accessible contrast.
- Google Fonts let me embed some nice webfonts and ensure they display correctly in your browser. Titles are in Roboto Slab and body text is in Roboto. 

### What's the deal with the URL? 
I just really like They Might Be Giants.
