#### 1. Hour of Code
I wrote this up while doing the activity, because I thought that would be fun! I'm doing the Escape Velocity and Black Holes activity. I'm an experienced coder, but I've only dabbled with Javascript, so I'm excited to get more experience!

#### 2. Unplugged Coding
And after I did all that, I took a look at <a href="https://classic.csunplugged.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/unplugged-05-information_theory.pdf" target="_blank">this activity on information content</a>.
