Here's the podcast!

I enlisted my boyfriend to interview me, but we like each other and want to talk to each other, so we ended up just having a discussion rather than a formal interview. We were originally going to talk about educational games, but eventually it became a discussion about computer literacy overall: how did we learn to work with computers; what's different now; should we all learn to code (yes!)---that kind of stuff. 

This was actually really fun! After doing this, I think I'd be interested in making a podcast FOR REAL, but there's also such a huge glut of them out there, so I'm not sure that I'd be adding anything of value. Plus, I'd have to work in weird sponsorship advertisements and beg for money through Patreon, and I don't wanna. 

*But* doing something like this with my students could be awesome! We could do a class series where pairs of students produce a podcast themed to whatever unit we're working on---like, rocket science when we do projectile motion, or music when we learn about waves. Every year could be a new season! We could do listening parties for the school! 

Warning before you listen: I say fuck *a lot*. So you might want to use headphones depending on where you're listening to this!
