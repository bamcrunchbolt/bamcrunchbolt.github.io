description: My products for the "Digital Imagination" assignment. The two creative ones are a series of images of celebration and a series of crude photoshops of my dog's face onto other pieces of art. There is also a link to a lesson plan in which students photograph glacial features and build the history of a landscape.

First things first: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQnOgnPjzDHEdXP4QmNO0kTB74YL6jngZy3hvSjKcHG_EHB-867IBOQzR3pDqOJCfkp_IfmNGgmMUsZ/pub" target="_blank">my lesson plan!</a> I figured I should put it at the top so it's easy to find. The gist of it is students go on a field trip to the Bison Range and take photos of the Missions and remnant shorelines and make a scrapbook/presentation/paper describing how glaciers shaped the landscape.

And now my creative projects! Or more artistically creative, because lesson planning can definitely be creative! I chose outcomes 1 (photo series of a particular subject) and 3 (image edited to the point of being art) because I thought they would be the most fun. I used <a href="http://gimp.org" target="_blank">GIMP</a> for all the editing; it's free and open and pretty good!

The text may show up pretty small, but you can full-screen each slideshow to overcome that. The slides are set to advance every 30 seconds but you should be able to click to advance each slide when you're done pondering my artistic genius.

Outcome 1: Photos of Celebration.
