description: My products for the "Digital Imagination" assignment. One is a series of images of celebration; the other is me photoshopping my dog's face into stuff 
title: Digital Imagination
---
I chose outcomes 1 (photo series of a particular subject) and 3 (image edited to the point of being art) because I thought they would be the most fun. I used <a href="http://gimp.org" target="_blank">GIMP</a> for all the editing; it's free and open and pretty good!

The text may show up pretty small, but you can full-screen each slideshow to overcome that. The slides are set to advance every 30 seconds but you should be able to click to advance each slide when you're done pondering my artistic genius.
