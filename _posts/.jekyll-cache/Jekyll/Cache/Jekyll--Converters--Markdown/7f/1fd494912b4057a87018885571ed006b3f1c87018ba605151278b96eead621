I"÷<p>Iâ€™ve set things up so that images resize themselves based on how big the window is, so if the code doesnâ€™t scan, try maximizing the window. I can get it to scan with a maximized browser (1366x768). Worst case, you might need to try right clicking and opening in a new window so that you can click on the image to zoom.</p>

<p>I was a little lazy and just linked the contact page on the GEO102 website I made.</p>
