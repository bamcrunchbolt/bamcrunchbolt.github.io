I"<p>This project was designed to get us all familiar with Google products and online collaboration, and also with a piece of technology, because we needed something to make the project about. I guess we could have made it a research project on the cloud, but maybe that would be too meta. So we did ours on <a href="https://kahoot.com">Kahoot!</a> instead.</p>

<p>We have a paper, a slideshow, and a quiz (on Google, not a Kahoot) available for your enjoyment!</p>

<ol>
  <li>Paper: available as a PDF on Box (see the “Collaboration and the Cloud” folder in the sidebar) or <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTSfDo8-d1HDdOhz0Gd0zlLxncsXQcSqH2HFs5VvfxhJoQpVmBYPXlYXX6puZ38rqH06Ejjps-jHH-B/pub">just right here</a>.</li>
  <li>Slideshow: also on Box, and <a href="#slides">embedded below</a>.</li>
  <li>Quiz: a PDF summarizing initial results is on Box; the quiz itself is <a href="#quiz">embedded below</a> if you’re into that.</li>
