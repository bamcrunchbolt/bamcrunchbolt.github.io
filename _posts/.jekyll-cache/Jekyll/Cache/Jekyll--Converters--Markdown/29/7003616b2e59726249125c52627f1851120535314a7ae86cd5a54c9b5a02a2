I"†<p>Hereâ€™s the podcast!</p>

<p>I enlisted my boyfriend to interview me, but we like each other and want to talk to each other, so we ended up just having a discussion rather than a formal interview. We were originally going to talk about educational games, but eventually it became a discussion about computer literacy overall: how did we learn to work with computers; whatâ€™s different now; should we all learn to code (yes!)â€”that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>This was actually really fun! After doing this, I think Iâ€™d be interested in making a podcast FOR REAL, but thereâ€™s also such a huge glut of them out there, so Iâ€™m not sure that Iâ€™d be adding anything of value. Plus, Iâ€™d have to work in weird sponsorship advertisements and beg for money through Patreon, and I donâ€™t wanna.</p>

<p><em>But</em> doing something like this with my students could be awesome! We could do a class series where pairs of students produce a podcast themed to whatever unit weâ€™re working onâ€”like, rocket science when we do projectile motion, or music when we learn about waves. Every year could be a new season! We could do listening parties for the school!</p>

<p>Warning before you listen: I say fuck <em>a lot</em>. So you might want to use headphones depending on where youâ€™re listening to this!</p>
