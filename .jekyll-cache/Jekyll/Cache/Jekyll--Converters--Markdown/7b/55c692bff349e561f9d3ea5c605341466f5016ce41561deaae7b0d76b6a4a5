I"å<p>So my mission is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>An active link</li>
<li>Image</li>
<li>Two Videos (one through You Tube search and one by embedding HTML)</li>
<li>Google Translate gadget</li>
<li>Box embed</li>
<li>RSS feeds</li>
<li>A post</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, this is a post, so HOORAY!</p>

<p>The translate widget, the Box embed, and an RSS feed for the four most recent episodes of Harry Potter and the Sacred Text are on every page. If youâ€™ve never listened to HPST before, I recommend going to <a href="" target="_blank">their website</a> and starting from the beginning.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s a picture of Shaq with a mouse lemur named Fuggles.
<img src="/assets/img/shaq_lemur.jpg" /></p>

<p>Because Iâ€™m not blogging through Google, I canâ€™t include videos in any way other than just coding it in, so Iâ€™ll give you only one video. I cannot imagine you could possibly want for another after this one.</p>
