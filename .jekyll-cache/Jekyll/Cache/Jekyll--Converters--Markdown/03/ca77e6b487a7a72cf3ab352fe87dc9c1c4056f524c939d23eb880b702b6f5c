<p>So the framework I’m using lets you blog really easily, except I don’t have that totally set up yet. I think we’d have to get you your own hosted site fir that, which is cheap and/or free depending on how you want to do it! And then I could get that all set up for you. Once it’s set up, the blogging itself is not hard.</p>
