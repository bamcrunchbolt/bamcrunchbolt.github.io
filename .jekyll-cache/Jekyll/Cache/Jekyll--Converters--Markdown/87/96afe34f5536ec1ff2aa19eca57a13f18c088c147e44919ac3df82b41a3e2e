<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/bamcrunchbolt/timelines/1201648324463345666" target="_blank">wrote this up while doing the activity</a>, because I thought that would be fun!

<p>And after I did all that, I took a look at <a href="https://classic.csunplugged.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/unplugged-05-information_theory.pdf" target="_blank">this activity on information content</a>.
