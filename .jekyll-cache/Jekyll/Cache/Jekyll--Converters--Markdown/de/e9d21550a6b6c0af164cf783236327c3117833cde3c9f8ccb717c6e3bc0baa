<p>So the framework Iâ€™m using lets you blog really easily, except I donâ€™t have that totally set up yet. I <em>think</em> weâ€™d have to get you your own hosted site for that, but that is cheap and/or free depending on how you want to do it! And then I could get that all set up for you. Once itâ€™s set up, the blogging itself is not hard. Although I guess you also have to decide whether blogging is a way you want to keep people updated on your doings.</p>
