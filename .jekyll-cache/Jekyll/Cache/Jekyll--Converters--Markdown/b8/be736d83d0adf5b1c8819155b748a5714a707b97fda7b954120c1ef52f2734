I"~<h3> --- About! ---</h3>

<p>I used <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> to make this blog, and it was really fun! If you’re comfortable with coding, you might have a good time playing around with it!</p>

<p>The fonts on the site are Montserrat for the titles and Cousine for the body text; both are free on Google Fonts.</p>

<p>The colors on this site are from the <a href="" target="_blank">Solarized</a> color scheme. They’re supposed to be easiest on the eyes. Probably they’d be even easier on the eyes if I went with the beige background, but if Evan Schooner doesn’t do that, then why should I?</p>
