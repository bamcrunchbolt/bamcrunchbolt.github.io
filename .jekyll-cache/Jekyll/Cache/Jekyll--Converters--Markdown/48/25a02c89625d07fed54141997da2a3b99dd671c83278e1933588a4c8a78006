I"Ž<p>So my mission is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>An active link</li>
<li>Image</li>
<li>Two Videos (one through You Tube search and one by embedding HTML)</li>
<li>Google Translate gadget</li>
<li>Box embed</li>
<li>RSS feeds</li>
<li>A post</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, this is a post, so HOORAY!</p>

<p>The translate widget, the Box embed, and an RSS feed for the four most recent episodes of Harry Potter and the Sacred Text are on every page. If youâ€™ve never listened to HPST before, I recommend <a href="https://www.harrypottersacredtext.com/listen-2" target="_blank">starting from the beginning</a>.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s a picture of Shaq with a mouse lemur named Fuggles.

<p>Because Iâ€™m not blogging through Google, I canâ€™t include videos in any way other than just coding it in, so Iâ€™ll give you only one video. But it is such a masterpiece that it is easily worth two, even three videos. Four videos.</p>
