I"h<p>This project was designed to get us all familiar with Google products and online collaboration, and also with a piece of technology, because we needed something to make the project about. I guess we could have made it a research project on the cloud, but maybe that would be too meta. So we did ours on <a href="https://kahoot.com">Kahoot!</a> instead.</p>
