I"J<p>I’ve set things up so that images resize themselves based on how big the window is, so if the code doesn’t scan, try maximizing the window. I can get it to scan with a maximized browser (1366x768). Worst case, you might need to try right clicking and opening in a new window so that you can click on the image to zoom.</p>
