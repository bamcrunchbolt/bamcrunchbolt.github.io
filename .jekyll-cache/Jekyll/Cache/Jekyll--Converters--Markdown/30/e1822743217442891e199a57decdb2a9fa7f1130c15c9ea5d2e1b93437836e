<p><a href="https://twitter.com/bamcrunchbolt/timelines/1201648324463345666" target="_blank">I wrote this up while doing the activity</a>, because I thought that would be fun! It looks like github is finnicky about some javascript widgets and it would be a Whole Thing to embed it, so you just get a link. I did the Escape Velocity and Black Holes activity. I’m an experienced coder, but I’ve only dabbled with Javascript, so I enjoyed getting more experience!
