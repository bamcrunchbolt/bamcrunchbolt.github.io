<dt>Capstone Lab Guides: Files and Previews</dt><dd>PASCO has its own software, called Capstone, that reads in data from its equipment, lets you process/manipulate/display those data, do lab notebook writeups, and do step-by-step guides. It even has a block coding interface for students to do engineering experiments! PASCO provides Capstone files for their labs, so I took their file and adapted it for my final product, which is a guide through the lab, with tables set up for students to record their data. They can type directly in the tables, gather data from the cart sensors, create and modify graphs based on functions they define. I also used their sample data files to show what it should look like when each step is followed. To view and play around with the Capstone files, you need to <a href="https://www.pasco.com/downloads/capstone/pasco-capstone-trial/index.cfm" target="_blank">download and install the free trial of Capstone</a>, but I have screenshots of each page in the guide in slideshows in case you don't want to install new software.</dd>
<dt><a href="" target="_blank">Shared Class Folder</a></dt><dd>This is where the students would access everything they needed for the lab, upload their Capstone files, and add their graph to the Results Share slideshow. I'm not submitting it as my Two Products but I figured I should still make it available!</dd>
