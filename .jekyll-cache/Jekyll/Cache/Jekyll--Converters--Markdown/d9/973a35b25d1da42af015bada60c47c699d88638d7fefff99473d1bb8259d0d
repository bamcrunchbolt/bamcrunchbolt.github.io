I"K<h3> --- About! ---</h3>

<p>I used <a href="" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> to make this blog, and it was really fun! If youâ€™re comfortable with coding, you might have a good time playing around with it!</p>

<p>The fonts on the site are Montserrat for the titles and Cousine for the body text; both are free on Google Fonts.</p>
