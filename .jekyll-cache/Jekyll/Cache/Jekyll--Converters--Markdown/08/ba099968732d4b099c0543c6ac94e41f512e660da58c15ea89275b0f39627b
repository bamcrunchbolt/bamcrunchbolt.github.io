<p><a href="https://twitter.com/bamcrunchbolt/timelines/1201648324463345666" target="_blank">I wrote this up while doing the activity</a>, because I thought that would be fun! It looks like github is finnicky about some javascript widgets and it would be a Whole Thing to embed it, so you just get a link. I did the Escape Velocity and Black Holes activity. Iâ€™m an experienced coder, but Iâ€™ve only dabbled with Javascript, so I enjoyed getting more experience!

<p>And after I did all that, I took a look at <a href="https://classic.csunplugged.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/unplugged-05-information_theory.pdf" target="_blank">this activity on information content</a>. You start by talking about what information is and how you can determine the amount of information in a sentence. For instance, vowels have low information content because you can read most sentences just fine without them; theyâ€™re basically empty calories and in computer science, we just want the meat.</p>

<p>Then, the kids play a modified version of Twenty Questions that models this concept, and thereâ€™s a follow-up worksheet for independent work. Then thereâ€™s some final wrap-up stuff applying this concept directly to computer science.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s targeted toward middle school students, but youâ€™d really just have to age the language up a little bit to make it high-school-appropriate. You only need the worksheet to do it, which is great, although Iâ€™d probably want to have a little writeup to accompany the game, since itâ€™s a modified version. Ideally, you want just yes/no questions since that mimics 1/0 bits. But I think this is a really neat activity, and takes a very abstract concept and makes it much easier to understand! Iâ€™d definitely use it in a programming class or a discrete math class.</p>
