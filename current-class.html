<p>Class starts at 9:00 on May 28! We've never run a lab during the summer before, so this should be fun! At least for me; you're probably not that excited.</p>
<p>I <em>highly</em> recommend reacquainting yourselves with some math before we get going.</p>
<h4>Unit conversions</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://serc.carleton.edu/mathyouneed/units/UnitExample.html">The Math You Need</a>: This has a set of worked examples that you can try. It hides the step-by-step solution from you so you can try it on your own, and when you're ready to check you work, you can reveal the answer. After that, it has a section called "Next Steps" with a link to an assessment---but don't do that; instead, you can try the worksheets linked in the "Still Need Practice?" section.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/units-in-modeling/rate-conversion/v/dimensional-analysis-units-algebraically">Dimensional Analysis</a>: Nice video walkthrough and some practice with unit conversions from Khan Academy.
<li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/units-in-modeling/appropriate-units/v/interpreting-units-in-formulas">Interpreting Units</a>: More Khan Academy, this time about matching up a formula (such as œÅ = m/V) with the approprate units (g/cm^3). </li>
</ul>
<h4>Statsy Stuff</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn83BA7cRNM">Mean, Median, Mode</a>: Conceptual overview from Crash Course Statistics. Their videos are outrageously helpful and actually fun to watch! I promise!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4yfNi_8Kqw">Measures of Spread</a>: More Crash Course Statistics! This video includes quartile ranges, variance, and standard deviation.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/data-distributions-a1/summarizing-spread-distributions/a/calculating-standard-deviation-step-by-step">How to Calculate the Standard Deviation</a>: Step-by-step article from Khan Academy.
